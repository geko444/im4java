INTRODUCTION
============

im4java is a pure-java interface to the ImageMagick
commandline. It is not meant as a replacement for JMagick, but as an addition.


LICENSE
=======

im4java is licensed under the LGPL (see file COPYING.LIB). Since
im4java is a wrapper libary, you should also make sure that you comply
to the individual license-statements of all the tools you use
indirectly through im4java.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

All documentation is now available in HTML and PDF. Point your browser
to doc/index.html. The documentation in the downloaded package usually
is a copy of the documentation available on the im4java-website.

Note that the source-distribution only contains the source for the
documentation (in doc-src/xdocs).

FEEDBACK
========

Any feedback (bug-reports, suggestions, criticism) is welcome. 
Currently, JMagick and im4java share a single mailing-list. You should
register to the jmagick-users mailing-list at jmagick.sourceforge.net.
