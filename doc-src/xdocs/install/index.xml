      <title>Installation</title>
      <p>
	There is no formal installation method. If you have downloaded
	the source-distribution and are using Linux, you should run
      </p>
      <source>
	$ &gt; make src jar
      </source>
      <p>
	This will generate and compile all source-files and generate the im4java
	library (the jar file <code>im4java-version.jar</code>). Note
	that compiling the library requires bash and make and the java
	development kit. If you use a different operating system, you
	must either install a unix-environment (e.g. <em>cygwin</em>
	for Windows), or you should download the binary distribution
	of im4java.
      </p>
      <p>
	After you created the im4java library (which is also part of
	the binary distribution), you just add it to the CLASSPATH of
	your project.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you want to recreate the documentation from source, you
	need <a href="ext:forrest">Apache Forrest</a>, version 0.8,
	and run
      </p>
      <source>
	$ &gt; make doc
      </source>

      <title>Support for JRE 1.5</title>
      <p>
	In case you need a version compatible with JRE 1.5, you can
	create a 1.5-compatible version from source with
      </p>
      <source>
	$ &gt; make src jar-1.5
      </source>
      <p>
	The binary distribution already has a 1.5-compatible version
	named  <code>im4java-version-1.5.jar</code>.
      </p>

      <title>Getting Started</title>
      <p>
	Once you have the library in place, you should read the <a
	  href="site:devguide">Developer's Guide</a> (at least the
	first section about setting up the environment for
	im4java). You might also consider running a number of
	tests. See <a href="site:tests">Running Tests</a> for details.
