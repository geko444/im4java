    options


Version 0.96.0
  * Source-generation now supports more than one interface-definition-file
  * Added support for GraphicsMagick. You can hard-code GM-usage, but
    if you stick to the common subset of IM and GM commands, you can
    switch to GM at runtime by setting the system-property im4java.useGM=true.
  * Added support for jpegtran
  * Added some utility-classes in org.im4java.process
  * ImageCommand now sends stdout to System.out as default
  * Incompatible change to IdentifyCmd: output is not captured by default
    anymore. To capture output, use the new class 
    org.im4java.process.ArrayListOutputConsumer. See
    org.im4java.test.Test.testIdentify() for an example.

  * Initial release
